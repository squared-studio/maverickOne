## Description

This module is mean to decode instruction into the decoded_instr_t as mentioned in the
[maverickOne_pkg](../../include/maverickOne_pkg.sv).
- The `func` field enumerates the function that the current instruction.
- The `rd` is the destination register ant the `rs1`, `rs2` & `rs3` are the source registers. An
  offset of 32 is added for the floating point registers' address.
- The `imm` has multi-purpose such signed/unsigned immediate, shift, csr_addr, etc. based on the
  `func`.
- The `pc` hold's the physical address of the current instruction.
- The `blocking` field is set high when the current instruction must block next instructions from
  execution.
- The `reg_req` field is a flag that indicates the registers that are required for the current
  instruction
